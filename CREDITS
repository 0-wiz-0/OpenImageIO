This is a list of all the authors of OpenImageIO.  Any such list is very
inexact, and can't convey everybody's precise level of contribution
(which is constantly shifting, anyway).  However, I've made two tiers:
(1) major developers who have contributed at least several hundred lines
of code (noting their main contributions, if easily identifiable); (2)
everybody else who has contributed any code at all.


Major contributors (roughly in order of joining the project):

    Larry Gritz        core classes & API, ImageCache/TextureSystem, iv,
                         TIFF, JPEG, OpenEXR, HDR, PNG, zfile, docs
    Philip Nemec       unit testing framework
    Dan Wexler         Windows port
    Chris Kulla        texture system improvements
    Chris Foster       lots of things!
