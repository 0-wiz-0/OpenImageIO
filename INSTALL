Installation instructions for OpenImageIO

Building OpenImageIO
--------------------

Supported platforms at present include Linux (32 and 64 bit),
and Mac OS X.  We intend to support Windows as soon as some brave
soul fixes up our Makefile's so they work under Windows (hint, hint).

On supported platforms, you can build from source from the top-level
directory by just typing 'make'.

During the make, various temporary files (object files, etc.) will
be put in build/PLATFORM, where 'PLATFORM' will be the name of the
platform you are building for (e.g., linux, linux64, macosx).

The result of the make will be a full binary distribution in 
dist/PLATFORM.

Sorry, that's as much as it does right now.  This is not ready for
release!  Soon we'll tar it up, have installers, etc.

Make targets you should know about:

    make                Same as 'make dist'
    make dist           Build an optimized distro in dist/PLATFORM,
                            with temp files created while building in
                            build/PLATFORM.
    make clean          Get rid of all the temporary files in 
                            build/PLATFORM
    make realclean      Get rid of both build/PLATFORM and dist/PLATFORM
    make nuke           Get rid of all build/ and dist/, for all
                            platforms
    make debug          Build a debugging (symbols, not stripped) distro,
                            will end up in dist/PLATFORM.debug
    make profile        Build a profilable version on dist/PLATFORM.profile
    make doxygen        Build the Doxygen docs
