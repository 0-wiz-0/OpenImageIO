\section{Helper Classes}
\label{sec:texturesys:helperclasses}

\subsection{Imath}

The texture functinality of \product uses the excellent open source
{\cf Ilmbase} package's {\cf Imath} types when it requires 3D vectors
and transformation matrixes.  Specifically, we use {\cf Imath::V3f}
for 3D positions and directions, and {\cf Imath::M44f} for $4 \times 4$
transformation matrices.  To use these yourself, we recommend that you:

\begin{code}
    #include <ImathVec.h>
    #include <ImathMatrix.h>
\end{code}

Please refer to the {\cf Ilmbase} and {\cf OpenEXR}
documentation and header files for more complete information about
use of these types in your own application.  However, note that you
are not strictly required to use these classes in your application ---
{\cf Imath::V3f} has a memory layout identical to {\cf float[3]}
and {\cf Imath::M44f} has a memory layout identical to {\cf float[16]},
so as long as your own internal vectors and matrices have the same
memory layout, it's ok to just cast pointers to them when passing
as arguments to \TextureSystem methods.

\subsection{{\cf VaryingRef}: encapsulate uniform and varying}

All of the texture access API routines are designed to loook up
texture efficiently at many points at once.  Therefore, many of
the parameters to the API routines, and many of the fields in
\TextureOptions need to accommodate both uniform and varying values.
\emph{Uniform} means that a single value may be used for each of
the many simultaneous texture lookups, whereas \emph{varying} means
that a different value is provided for each of the positions where
you are sampling the texture.

Please read the comments in \qkw{varyingref.h} for the full gory 
details, but here's all you really need to know about it to use the
texture functionality.  Let's suppose that we have a routine 
whose prototype looks like this:

\begin{code}
        void API (int n, VaryingRef<float> x);
\end{code}

\noindent This means that parameter $x$ may either be a single value
for use at each of the $n$ texture lookups, or it may have $n$ different
values of $x$.  

If you want to pas a uniform value, you may do any of the following:

\begin{code}
      float x;   // just one value
      API (n, x);   // automatically knows what to do!
      API (n, &x);  // Also ok to pass the pointer to x
      API (n, VaryingRef<float>(x));  // Wordy but correct
      API (n, Uniform(x));  // Shorthand
\end{code}

If you want to pass a varying value, i.e., an array of values,

\begin{code}
      float x[n];   // One value for each of n points
      API (n, VaryingRef<float>(x), sizeof(x));  // Wordy but correct
      API (n, Varying(x));  // Shorthand if stride is sizeof(x)
\end{code}

You can also initialize a VaryingRef directly:

\begin{code}
    float x;     // just one value
    float y[n];  // array of values
    VaryingRef<float> r;
    r.init (&x);                 // Initialize to uniform
    r.init (&x, 0);              // Initialize to uniform the wordy way
    r.init (&y, sizeof(float));  // Initialize to varying
    ...
    API (n, r);
\end{code}

\subsection{\TextureOptions}

\TextureOptions is a structure that holds many options controlling
individual texture lookups.  Because each texture lookup API call takes
a reference to a \TextureOptions, the call signatures remain uncluttered
rather than having an ever-growing list of parameters, most of which
will never vary from their defaults.  Here is a brief description of
the data members of a \TextureOptions structure:

\apiitem{int nchannels\\
int firstchannel}
The number of color channels to look up from the texture --- for
example, 1 (single channel), or 3 (for an RGB triple) --- and the number
of channels to look up.  The defaults are firstchannel = 0, nchannels =
1.

Examples: To retrieve the first three channels (typically RGB), you
should have nchannels = 3, firstchannel = 0.  To retrieve just the blue
channel, you should have nchannels = 1, firstchannel = 2.
\apiend

\apiitem{Wrap swrap, twrap}
Specify the \emph{wrap mode} for 2D texture lookups (and 3D volume
texture lookups, using the additional {\cf zwrap} field).  These fields
are ignored for shadow and environment lookups.

These specify what happens when texture coordinates are found to be
outside the usual $[0,1]$ range over which the texture is defined.
{\cf Wrap} is an enumerated type that may take on any of the
following values:
\begin{description}
\item[\spc] \spc
\item[\rm \kw{WrapBlack}] The texture is black outside the [0,1] range.
\item[\rm \kw{WrapClamp}] The texture coordinates will be clamped to
  [0,1], i.e., the value outside [0,1] will be the same as the color
  at the nearest point on the border.
\item[\rm \kw{WrapPeriodic}] The texture is periodic, i.e., wraps back
  to 0 after going past 1.
\item[\rm \kw{WrapMirror}] The texture presents a mirror image at the
  edges, i.e., the coordinates go from 0 to 1, then back down to 0, then
  back up to 1, etc.
\item[\rm \kw{WrapDefault}] Use whatever wrap might be specified in the
  texture file itself, or some other suitable default (caveat emptor).
\end{description}

The wrap mode does not need to be identical in the $s$ and $t$
directions.
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> swidth, twidth}
For each direction, gives a multiplier for the derivatives.  Note that
a width of 0 indicates a point sampled lookup (assuming that blur is
also zero).  The default width is 1, indicating that the derivatives
should guide the amount of blur applied to the texture filtering (not
counting any additional \emph{blur} specified).
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> sblur, tblur}
For each direction, specifies an additional amount of pre-blur to apply
to the texture (\emph{after} derivatives are taken into account),
expressed as a portion of the width of the texture.  In other words,
blur = 0.1 means that the texture lookup should act as if the texture
was pre-blurred with a filter kernel with a width 1/10 the size of the
full image.  The default blur amount is 0, indicating a sharp texture
lookup.
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> bias}
For shadow map lookups only, this gives the ``shadow bias'' amount.
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> fill}
Specifies the value that will be used for any color channels that are
requested but not found in the file.  For example, if you perform a
3-channel lookup on a 1-channel texture, the second two channels will
get the fill value.
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<int> samples}
The number of samples to use for each lookup.  Currently this only
applies for certain types of shadow maps.
\apiend

\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> alpha}
Specifies a \emph{destination} for one additional channel to be looked
up, the one immediately following the return value (i.e., channel
$\mathit{firstchannel}+\mathit{nchannels}$).  The point of this is to
allow a 4-channel lookup, with the 4th channel put in an entirely
different variable than the 3-channel color.  The default for {\cf
  alpha} is to point to NULL, indicating that no extra alpha channel
should be retrieved.
\apiend

\apiitem{Wrap zwrap \\
VaryingRef<float> zblur, zwidth}
Specifies wrap, blur, and width for 3D volume texture lookups only.
\apiend

\subsection{SIMD Run Flags}

Most of the texture lookup API routines are written to accommodate
queries about many points at once.  Furthermore, only a subset of
points may need to compute.  This is all expressed using three
parameters:  {\cf Runflag *runflags, int firstactive, int lastactive}.
There are also {\cf VaryingRef} parameters such as {\cf s} and {\cf t}
that act as if they are arrays.

The {\cf firstactive} and {\cf lastactive} indices are the first and
last (inclusive) points that should be computed, and for each point
{\cf runflags[i]} is nonzero if the point should be computed.  To
illustrate, here is how a routine might be written that would copy
values in {\cf arg} to {\cf result} using runflags:

\begin{code}
        void copy (Runflag *runflags, int firstactive, int lastactive,
                   VaryingRef<float> arg, VaryingRef <float> result)
        {
            for (int i = firstactive; i <= lastactive;  ++i)
                if (runflags[i])
                    result[i] = arg[i];
        }
\end{code}

\section{TextureSystem API}
\label{sec:texturesys:api}

\subsection{Creating and destroying texture systems}
\label{sec:texturesys:api:createdestroy}

\TextureSystem is an abstract API described as a pure
virtual class.  The actual internal implementation is not exposed
through the external API of \product.  Because of this, you cannot
construct or destroy the concrete implementation, so two static
methods of \TextureSystem are provided:

\apiitem{static TextureSystem *TextureSystem::{\ce create}()}
Creates a new \TextureSystem and returns a pointer to it.
\apiend

\apiitem{static void TextureSystem::{\ce destroy} (TextureSystem * \&x)}
Destroys an allocated \TextureSystem, including freeing all system
resources that it holds.

This is necessary to ensure that the memory is freed in a way that
matches the way it was allocated within the library.  Note that simply
using {\cf delete} on the pointer will not always work (at least,
not on some platforms in which a DSO/DLL can end up using a different
allocator than the main program).
\apiend

\subsection{Setting options and limits for the texture system}
\label{sec:texturesys:api:options}

The following member functions of \TextureSystem allow you to set
(and in some cases retrieve) options that control the overall
behavior of the texture system:

\apiitem{void {\ce max_open_files} (int nfiles)}
Sets the maximum number of file handles that the texture system will
hold open simultaneously.  (Default = 100)
\apiend

\apiitem{void {\ce max_memory_MB} (float size)}
Sets the maximum amount of memory (measured in MB) that the texture
system will use for its ``tile cache.'' (Default: 50 MB)
\apiend

\apiitem{void {\ce searchpath} (const std::string \&path)}
Sets the search path for textures: a colon-separated list of
directories that will be searched in order for any texture name
that is not specified as an absolute path.
\apiend

\apiitem{void {\ce worldtocommon} (const float *mx) \\
void {\ce worldtocommon} (const Imath::M44f \&w2c)}
Sets the $4 \times 4$ matrix that provides the spatial transformation
from ``world'' to a ``common'' coordinate system.  This is used for
shadow map lookups, in which the shadow map itself encodes the
world coordinate system, but positions passed to {\cf shadow()} are
expressed in ``common'' coordinates.

There are two versions of this method: one takes a reference to
a {\cf Imath:M44f}, the other that takes a pointer to 16 contiguous
floats.
\apiend

\apiitem{int {\ce max_open_files} () const}
Returns the current value of the maximum number of file handles that
the texture library will hold open.
\apiend

\apiitem{float {\ce max_memory_MB} () const}
Returns the current value of the maximum amount of memory (in MB)
the texture library will use for the tile cache.
\apiend

\apiitem{std::string {\ce searchpath} () const}
Returns the current search path for textures.
\apiend

\newpage
\subsection{Texture Lookups}
\label{sec:texturesys:api:texture}

\apiitem{void {\ce texture} (ustring filename, TextureOptions \&options,\\
\bigspc                   float s, float t, float dsdx, float dtdx,\\
\bigspc                   float dsdy, float dtdy, float *result)}

Perform a filtered 2D texture lookup on a position centered at 2D
coordinates ({\cf s}, {\cf t}) from the texture identified by
{\cf filename}, and using relevant texture {\cf options}.  The filtered
results will be stored in {\cf result[]}.

We assume that this lookup will be part of an image that has pixel
coordinates {\cf x} and {\cf y}.  By knowing how {\cf s} and {\cf t}
change from pixel to pixel in the final image, we can properly
\emph{filter} or antialias the texture lookups.  This information is
given via derivatives {\cf dsdx} and {\cf dsdx} that define the change
in {\cf s} and {\cf t} per unit of {\cf x}, and {\cf dsdy} and {\cf
  dsdy} that define the change in {\cf s} and {\cf t} per unit of {\cf
  y}.  If it is impossible to know the derivatives, you may pass 0 for
them, but in that case you will not receive an antialiased texture lookup.

Fields within {\cf options} that are honored for 2D texture lookups
include the following:

\vspace{-12pt}
\apiitem{int nchannels\\
int firstchannel}
\vspace{10pt}
The number of color channels to look up from the texture.
\apiend

\vspace{-24pt}
\apiitem{Wrap swrap, twrap}
\vspace{10pt}
Specify the \emph{wrap mode} for each direction, one of: 
{\cf WrapBlack}, {\cf WrapClamp}, {\cf WrapPeriodic}, {\cf WrapMirror},
or {\cf WrapDefault}.
\apiend

\vspace{-24pt}
\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> swidth, twidth}
\vspace{10pt}
For each direction, gives a multiplier for the derivatives.
\apiend

\vspace{-24pt}
\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> sblur, tblur}
\vspace{10pt}
For each direction, specifies an additional amount of pre-blur to apply
to the texture (\emph{after} derivatives are taken into account),
expressed as a portion of the width of the texture.
\apiend

\vspace{-24pt}
\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> fill}
\vspace{10pt}
Specifies the value that will be used for any color channels that are
requested but not found in the file.
\apiend

\vspace{-24pt}
\apiitem{VaryingRef<float> alpha}
\vspace{10pt}
Specifies a \emph{destination} for one additional channel to be looked
up, the one immediately following the return value (i.e., channel
$\mathit{firstchannel}+\mathit{nchannels}$).  The point of this is to
allow a 4-channel lookup, with the 4th channel put in an entirely
different variable than the 3-channel color.  The default for {\cf
  alpha} is to point to NULL, indicating that no extra alpha channel
should be retrieved.
\apiend

\apiend


\apiitem{void {\ce texture} (ustring filename, TextureOptions \&options,\\
\bigspc                   Runflag *runflags, int firstactive, int lastactive,\\

\bigspc                   VaryingRef<float> dsdy, VaryingRef<float> dtdy,\\
\bigspc                   float *result)}

Perform filtered 2D texture lookups on a collection of positions all at
once, which may be much more efficient than repeatedly calling the
single-point version of {\cf texture()}.  The parameters {\cf s},
{\cf t}, {\cf dsdx}, {\cf dtdx}, and {\cf dsdy}, {\cf dtdy} are now
{\cf VaryingRef}'s that may refer to either a single or an array of
values, as are all the fields in the {\cf options}.

Texture will be computed at indices {\cf firstactive} through
{\cf lastactive}, inclusive, but only at indices where {\cf runflags[i]}
is nonzero.  Results will be stored at corresponding positions of
{\cf result}, that is, 
{\cf result[i*n ... (i+1)*n-1]} where $n$ is the number of channels
requested by {\cf options.nchannels}.

\bigspc                          const Imath::V3f \&dPdy,\\
\bigspc                          float *result)}

Perform a filtered 3D volumetric texture lookup on a position centered at
3D position {\cf P} from the texture identified by
{\cf filename}, and using relevant texture {\cf options}.  The filtered
results will be stored in {\cf result[]}.

We assume that this lookup will be part of an image that has pixel
coordinates {\cf x} and {\cf y}.  By knowing how {\cf P} changes from
pixel to pixel in the final image, we can properly \emph{filter} or
antialias the texture lookups.  This information is given via
derivatives {\cf dPdx} and {\cf dPdy} that define the changes in {\cf P}
per unit of {\cf x} and {\cf y}, respectively.  If it is impossible to
know the derivatives, you may pass 0 for them, but in that case you will
not receive an antialiased texture lookup.

Perform a shadow map lookup on a position centered at 3D

{\cf filename}, and using relevant texture {\cf options}.  The filtered
results will be stored in {\cf result[]}.

We assume that this lookup will be part of an image that has pixel

allow a 4-channel lookup, with the 4th channel put in an entirely
different variable than the 3-channel color.  The default for {\cf
  alpha} is to point to NULL, indicating that no extra alpha channel
should be retrieved.

Perform filtered directional environment map lookups on a collection of positions all at
once, which may be much more efficient than repeatedly calling the
single-point version of {\cf texture()}.  The parameters {\cf R},
{\cf dRdx}, and {\cf dRdy} are now
{\cf VaryingRef}'s that may refer to either a single or an array of
values, as are all the fields in the {\cf options}.

Results will be computed at indices {\cf firstactive} through
{\cf lastactive}, inclusive, but only at indices where {\cf runflags[i]}
is nonzero.  Results will be stored at corresponding positions of
{\cf result}, that is, {\cf result[i*n ... (i+1)*n-1]} where $n$ 
is the number of channels requested by {\cf options.nchannels}.

\subsection{Texture Metadata}
\label{sec:texturesys:api:gettextureinfo}

\apiitem{bool {\ce gettextureinfo} (ustring filename, ustring dataname, \\
\bigspc                                 TypeDesc datatype, void *data)}

Retrieves information about the texture named by {\cf filename}.
The {\cf dataname} is a keyword indcating what information should
be retrieved, {\cf datatype} is the type of data expected, and
{\cf data} points to caller-owned memory where the results should be
placed.  It is up to the caller to ensure that {\cf data} contains
enough space to hold an item of the requested {\cf datatype}.

The return value is {\cf true} if {\cf gettextureinfo()} is able
to find the requested {\cf dataname} and it matched the requested
{\cf datatype}.  If the requested data was not found, or was not
of the right data type, {\cf gettextureinfo()} will return {\cf false}.

Supported {\cf dataname} values include:

\begin{description}
\item[\spc] \spc
\vspace{-12pt} \item[\rm \kw{resolution}] The resolution of the texture file, which
is an array of 2 integers (described as {\cf TypeDesc(INT,2)}).

\item[\rm \kw{texturetype}] A string describing the type of texture
of the given file.  

\item[\rm \kw{textureformat}] A string describing the format of the
given file.  

\item[\rm \kw{channels}] The number of color channels in the file 
(an integer).

\item[\rm \kw{viewingmatrix}] The viewing matrix, which is a
$4 \times 4$ matrix (an {\cf Imath::M44f}, described as {\cf
  TypeDesc(FLOAT,MATRIX)}).

\item[\rm \kw{projectionmatrix}] The projection matrix, which is a
$4 \times 4$ matrix (an {\cf Imath::M44f}, described as {\cf
  TypeDesc(FLOAT,MATRIX)}).

\item[Anything else] -- For all other data names, the
the metadata of the image file will be searched for an item that
matches both the name and data type.
