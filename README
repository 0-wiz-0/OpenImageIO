README for OpenImageIO
======================


Introduction
------------

OpenImageIO consists of:

  * Simple but powerful ImageInput and ImageOutput APIs that provide
    an abstraction for reading and writing image files of nearly any
    format, without the calling application needing to know any of the
    details of these file formats, and indeed without the calling 
    application needing to be aware of which formats are available.

  * A library that manages subclasses of ImageInput and ImageOutput that
    implement I/O from specific file formats, with each file format's
    implementation stored as a plug-in.  Therefore, an application using
    OpenImageIO's APIs can read and write any image file for which a
    plugin can be found at runtime.

  * Plugins implementing I/O for several popular image file formats,
    including TIFF, JPEG/JFIF, OpenEXR, PNG, and HDR/RGBE.

  * An image viewer, iv, that is based on ImageIO plugins and therefore
    can read images of any format for which an appropriate plugin may be
    found.

  * Several other image utilities, including image information, 
    format conversion, image comparison, and others.

  * A library for image texture lookups, included sophisticated cache
    management so that an application using the library may access
    thousands of textures totalling hundreds of Gigabytes, all with a
    runtime memory footprint of merely tens of Megabytes.
